## Survey of nature inspired heuristic algorithms to solve Travelling Salesman Problem
TSP is a famous problem, its exponential complexity currently exclude all greedy algorithms. Nature inspired algorithms have shown a certain ability, to give an extremely good approximation of the solution.

This repository is here to regroup the implementation in python of all covered algorithms to solved TSP:
- Ant Colony Optimisation (aco.py)
- Particle Swarm Optimisation (pso.py)
- Honeybees Mating Optimisation (hbmo.py)

optimization is not guaranted
